Good is for those who do good in this world...\") means, the one who does good deeds in this world, will have a good (reward) in this world and in the Hereafter.\nوَأَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةٌ\n(and Allah's earth is spacious!) Mujahid said, \"So emigrate through it and strive hard and keep away from idols.\"\nإِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى الصَّـبِرُونَ أَجْرَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ\n(Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.) Al-`Awza`i said, \"Their reward will not be weighed or measured; they will be given an immense reward.\" As-Suddi said:\nإِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى الصَّـبِرُونَ أَجْرَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ\n(Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.) means, \"In Paradise.\"\nقُلْ إِنِّى أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ الدِّينَ\n(Say: \"Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah, making religion sincerely for Him...\") means, `I am commanded to worship Allah alone in all sincerity, with no partner or associate.'\nوَأُمِرْتُ لاًّنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(And I am commanded (this) in order that I may be the first of the Muslims.)"

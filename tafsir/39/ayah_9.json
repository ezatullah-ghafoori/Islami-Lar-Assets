    "text": "Good News for the Righteous `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, narrating from his father\nوَالَّذِينَ اجْتَنَبُواْ الطَّـغُوتَ أَن يَعْبُدُوهَا\n(Those who avoid At-Taghut by not worshipping them) was revealed concerning Zayd bin `Amr bin Nufayl and Abu Dharr and Salman Al-Farisi, may Allah be pleased with them. The correct view is that it includes them and all others who avoided worshipping idols and turned to the worship of Ar-Rahman. These are the people for whom there is good news in this world and in the Hereafter. Then Allah says:\nفَبَشِّرْ عِبَادِالَّذِينَ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقَوْلَ فَيَـتَّبِعُونَ أَحْسَنَهُ\n(so announce the good news to My servants -- those who listen to the Word and follow the best thereof,) meaning, those who understand it and act in accordance with it. This is like the Words of Allah, may He be exalted, to Musa, peace be upon him, when He gave him the Tawrah:\nفَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُواْ بِأَحْسَنِهَا\n(Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein) (7:145).\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَاهُمُ اللَّهُ\n(those are whom Allah has guided) means, those who are described in this manner are the ones whom Allah has guided in this world and the Hereafter.\nوَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمْ أُوْلُو الاٌّلْبَـبِ\n(and those are men of understanding.) means, they possess sound reasoning and an upright nature."

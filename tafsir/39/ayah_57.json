    "text": "The Consequences for Those Who tell Lies against Allah and for Those Who have Taqwa\nAllah tells us that on the Day of Resurrection, some faces will be blackened and some will be whitened. The faces of those who followed splits and divisions will be blackened, and the faces of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah will be whitened. Allah says here:\nوَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ تَرَى الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ\n(And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied against Allah) meaning, by their claims that He had partners or offspring.\nوُجُوهُهُم مُّسْوَدَّةٌ\n(their faces will be black.) means, because of their lies and fabrications.\nأَلَيْسَ فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ\n(Is there not in Hell an abode for the arrogant) means, is not Hell sufficient for them as a prison and humiliating final destination, because of their stubborn pride, arrogance and refusal to follow the truth\nوَيُنَجِّى اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْاْ بِمَفَازَتِهِمْ\n(And Allah will deliver those who are those who have Taqwa to their places of success.) means, because of what Allah has decreed for them of happiness and victory.\nلاَ يَمَسُّهُمُ السُّوءُ\n(Evil shall touch them not, ) means, on the Day of Resurrection.\nوَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n(nor shall they grieve.) means, the greater terror (of that Day) will not cause them grief, for they will be safe from all grief and removed from all evil, and they will attain all that is good."

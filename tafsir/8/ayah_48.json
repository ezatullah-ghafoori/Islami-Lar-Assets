So We behaved with them according to Our Da'b, that is, Our behavior or custom and way, as We did with them with what We often do and decide concerning their likes, the denying people of Fir`awn and the earlier nations who rejected the Messengers and disbelieved in Our Ayat,'\nفَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ\n(so Allah punished them for their sins.)\nBecause of their sins, Allah destroyed them\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n(Verily, Allah is All-Strong, severe in punishment.)\nnone can resist Him or escape His grasp."

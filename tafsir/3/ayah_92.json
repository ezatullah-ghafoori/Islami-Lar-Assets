    "text": "Allah Warns the Idolators\nSa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When Allah's statement,\nمَّن ذَا الَّذِى  يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً\n(Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it  to him many times) 2:245 was revealed, the Jews said, `O Muhammad! Has your  Lord become poor so that He asks His servants to give Him a loan' Allah sent  down,\nلَّقَدْ سَمِعَ  اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ  أَغْنِيَآءُ\n(Indeed, Allah has heard the statement of those (Jews) who say: \"Truly, Allah  is poor and we are rich!\") 3:181.\"\nThis Hadith was collected by Ibn Marduwyah and Ibn Abi Hatim.\nAllah's statement,\nسَنَكْتُبُ مَا  قَالُواْ\n(We shall record what they have said) contains a threat and a warning that  Allah followed with His statement,\nوَقَتْلِهِمُ  الاٌّنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ\n(and their killing of the Prophets unjustly,)\nThis is what they say about Allah and this is how they treat His Messengers.  Allah will punish them for these deeds in the worst manner,\nلَّقَدْ سَمِعَ  اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ  سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُواْ وَقَتْلَهُمُ الاٌّنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ  ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ - ذلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ  لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(and We shall say: \"Taste you the torment of the burning (Fire).\" This is  because of that which your hands have sent before you. And certainly, Allah is  never unjust to (His) servants.)\nThey will be addressed like this as a way of chastising, criticism, disgrace  and humiliation.\nAllah said,\nالَّذِينَ قَالُواْ  إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَهِدَ إِلَيْنَا أَلاَّ نُؤْمِنَ لِرَسُولٍ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَنَا  بِقُرْبَانٍ تَأْكُلُهُ النَّارُ\n(Those (Jews) who said: \"Verily, Allah has taken our promise not to believe  in any Messenger unless he brings to us an offering which the fire (from heaven)  shall devour.\")\nAllah refuted their claim that in their Books, Allah took a covenant from  them to only believe in the Messenger whose miracles include fire coming down  from the sky that consumes the charity offered by a member of the Messenger's  nation, as Ibn `Abbas and Al-Hasan stated. Allah replied,\nقُلْ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ  رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ\n(Say: \"Verily, there came to you Messengers before me, with Al-Bayinat...\")  with proofs and evidence,\nوَبِالَّذِى  قُلْتُمْ\n(and even with what you speak of) a fire that consumes the accepted charity,  as you asked,\nفَلِمَ  قَتَلْتُمُوهُمْ\n(why then did you kill them) Why did you meet these Prophets with denial,  defiance, stubbornness and even murder,\nإِن كُنتُمْ  صَـدِقِينَ\n(if you are truthful), if you follow the truth and obey the Messengers.\nAllah then comforts His Prophet Muhammad ,\nفَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ  فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُوا بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ وَالزُّبُرِ  وَالْكِتَـبِ الْمُنِيرِ\n(Then if they reject you, so were Messengers rejected before you, who came  with Al-Baiyyinat and the Scripture, and the Book of Enlightenment.) meaning, do  not be sad because they deny you, for you have an example in the Messengers who  came before you. These Messengers were rejected although they brought clear  proofs, plain evidence and unequivocal signs,\nوَالزُّبُرِ\n(and the Zubur), the divinely revealed Books that were sent down to the  Messengers,\nوَالْكِتَـبِ  الْمُنِيرِ\n(and the Book of Enlightenment) meaning the clarification and best  explanation."

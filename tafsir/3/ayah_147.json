    "text": "The Description of `Isa and the Miracles He Performed\nAllah states that the good news brought to Maryam about `Isa was even better because Allah would teach him,\nالْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ\n(the Book and Al-Hikmah). It appears that the `Book' the Ayah mentioned here refers to writing. We explained the meaning of Al-Hikmah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah.\nالتَّوْرَاةَ وَالإِنجِيلَ\n(the Tawrah and the Injil). The Tawrah is the Book that Allah sent down to Musa, son of `Imran, while the Injil is what Allah sent down to `Isa, son of Maryam, peace be upon them, and `Isa memorized both Books. Allah's statement,\nوَرَسُولاً إِلَى بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And will make him a Messenger to the Children of Israel) means, that Allah will send `Isa as a Messenger to the Children of Israel, proclaiming to them,\nأَنِّى قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِى أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ\n(I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah's leave). These are the miracles that `Isa performed; he used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow into it, and it became a bird by Allah's leave. Allah made this a miracle for `Isa to testify that He had sent him.\nوَأُبْرِىءُ الاٌّكْمَهَ\n(And I heal him who is Akmah) meaning, `a person who was born blind,' which perfects this miracle and makes the challenge more daring.\nوَالاٌّبْرَصَ\n(And the leper) which is a known disease,\nوَأُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ\n(And I bring the dead to life by Allah's leave).\nMany scholars stated that Allah sent every Prophet with a miracle suitable to his time. For instance, in the time of Musa, magic was the trade of the time, and magicians held a high position. So Allah sent Musa with a miracle that captured the eyes and bewildered every magician. When the magicians realized that Musa's miracle came from the Almighty, Most Great, they embraced Islam and became pious believers. As for `Isa, he was sent during a time when medicine and knowledge in physics were advancing. `Isa brought them the types of miracles that could not be performed, except by one sent by Allah. How can any physician bring life to clay, cure blindness and leprosy and bring back to life those entrapped in the grave Muhammad ﷺ was sent during the time of eloquent people and proficient poets. He brought them a Book from Allah; if mankind and the Jinn tried to imitate ten chapters, or even one chapter of it, they will utterly fail in this task, even if they tried to do it by collective cooperation. This is because the Qur'an is the Word of Allah and is nothing like that of the creatures.\n`Isa's statement,\nوَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِى بُيُوتِكُمْ\n(And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses) means, I tell you about what one of you has just eaten and what he is keeping in his house for tomorrow.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ\n(Surely, therein), all these miracles,\nلأَيَةً لَّكُمْ\n(is a sign for you) testifying to the truth of what I was sent to you with,\nإِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَوَمُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ\n(If you believe. And I have come confirming that which was before me of the Tawrah,) affirming the Tawrah and upholding it,\nوَلاٌّحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you.)\nThis part of the Ayah indicates that `Isa abrogated some of the Laws of the Tawrah and informed the Jews of the truth regarding some issues that they used to dispute about. In another Ayah;\nوَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ\n(And in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ) 43:63.\n`Isa said next,\nوَجِئْتُكُمْ بِأَيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ\n(And I have come to you with a proof from your Lord.) \"Containing affirmation and evidence to the truth of what I am conveying to you.\"\nفَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ\n(So have Taqwa of Allah and obey me. Truly, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone).) for I and you are equal in our servitude, submission and humbleness to Him,\nهَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ\n(This is the straight path.)"

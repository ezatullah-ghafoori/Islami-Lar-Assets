    "text": "Al-Birr is Spending from the Best of One's Wealth\nIn his Tafsir, Waki` reported, that `Amr bin Maymun said that\nلَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ\n(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr) is in reference to attaining Paradise.\nImam Ahmad reported that Anas bin Malik said, \"Abu Talhah had more property than any other among the Ansar in Al-Madinah, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bayruha' garden, which was in front of the (Messenger's) Masjid. Sometimes, Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to go to the garden and drink its fresh water.\" Anas added, \"When these verses were revealed,\nلَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ\n(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr unless You spend of that which you love,)\nAbu Talhah said, `O Allah's Messenger! Allah says,\nلَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ\n(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love;) No doubt, Bayruha' garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's cause, and I expect its reward and compensation from Allah. O Allah's Messenger! Spend it where Allah makes you think is feasible. ' On that, Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«بَخٍ بَخٍ، ذَاكَ مَالٌ رَابِحٌ، ذَاكَ مَالٌ رَابِحٌ، وَقَدْ سَمِعْتُ، وَأَنَا أَرَى أَنْ تَجْعَلَهَا فِي الْأَقْرَبِين»\n(Well-done! It is profitable property, it is profitable property. I have heard what you have said, and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your kith and kin.)\nAbu Talhah said, `I will do so, O Allah's Messenger.' Then Abu Talhah distributed that garden among his relatives and cousins.\"\nThis Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. They also recorded that `Umar said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I never gained possession of a piece of property more precious to me than my share in Khaybar. Therefore, what do you command me to do with it\" The Prophet said,\n«حَبِّسِ الْأَصْلَ وَسَبِّلِ الثَّمَرَة»\n(Retain the land to give its fruits in Allah's cause.)"

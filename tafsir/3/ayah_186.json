    "text": "Allah Does Not Guide People Who Disbelieve After they Believed, Unless They Repent\nIbn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"A man from the Ansar embraced Islam, but later reverted and joined the polytheists. He later on became sorry and sent his people to, `Ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for me, if I can repent.' Then,\nكَيْفَ يَهْدِى اللَّهُ قَوْمًا كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِهِمْ\n(How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief) until,\nفَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) was revealed and his people sent word to him and he re-embraced Islam.\"\nThis is the wording recorded by An-Nasa'i, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.\"\nAllah's statement,\nكَيْفَ يَهْدِى اللَّهُ قَوْمًا كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِهِمْ وَشَهِدُواْ أَنَّ الرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَآءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَـتُ\n(How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger is true and after clear proofs came to them)\nmeans, the proofs and evidences were established, testifying to the truth of what the Messenger was sent with. The truth was thus explained to them, but they reverted to the darkness of polytheism. Therefore, how can such people deserve guidance after they willingly leapt into utter blindness This is why Allah said,\nوَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(And Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.)\nHe then said,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(They are those whose recompense is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of the angels and of all mankind.)\nAllah curses them and His creation also curses them.\nخَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ\n(They will abide therein) in the curse,\nلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ\n(Neither will their torment be lightened nor will it be delayed or postponed.) for, the torment will not be lessened, not even for an hour. After that, Allah said,\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(Except for those who repent after that and do righteous deeds. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)\nThis Ayah indicates Allah's kindness, graciousness, compassion, mercy and favor on His creatures when they repent to Him, for He forgives them in this case."

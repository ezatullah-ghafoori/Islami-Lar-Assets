    "text": "Allah states that He has perfect knowledge in the heavens and earth and that nothing in them is hidden from His watch.\nهُوَ الَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي الاٌّرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ\n(He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills.) meaning, He creates you in the wombs as He wills, whether male or female, handsome or otherwise, happy or miserable.\nلاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ\n(La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Almighty, the All-Wise.) meaning, He is the Creator and thus is the only deity worthy of worship, without partners, and His is the perfect might, wisdom and decision. This Ayah refers to the fact that `Isa, son of Mary, is a created servant, just as Allah created the rest of mankind. Allah created `Isa in the womb (of his mother) and shaped him as He willed. Therefore, how could `Isa be divine, as the Christians, may Allah's curses descend on them, claim `Isa was created in the womb and his creation changed from stage to stage, just as Allah said,\nيَخْلُقُكُمْ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَـتِكُـمْ خَلْقاً مِّن بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتٍ ثَلَـثٍ\n(He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.) 39:6."

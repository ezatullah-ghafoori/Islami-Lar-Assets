    "text": "The gods of the Idolators are Created, they do not create\nThen Allah tells us that the idols which people call on instead of Him cannot create anything, they are themselves created, as Al-Khalil (Ibrahim) said:\nقَالَ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مَا تَنْحِتُونَ - وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(\"Do you worship that which you (yourselves) carve While Allah has created you and what you make!\") (37:-96).\nأَمْوتٌ غَيْرُ أَحْيَآءٍ\n((They are) dead, not alive) means, they are inanimate and lifeless, they do not hear, see, or think.\nوَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(and they know not when they will be resurrected.) meaning, they do not know when the Hour will come, so how can anyone hope for any benefit or reward from these idols They should hope for it from the One Who knows all things and is the Creator of all things."

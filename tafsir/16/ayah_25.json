    "text": "He selected him, as Allah says :\nوَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَـلِمِينَ\n(And before, We indeed gave Ibrahim his integrity, and We were indeed most knowledgeable about him)(21:51). Then Allah says:\nوَهَدَاهُ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and guided him to a straight path.) which means to worship Allah alone, without partners or associate, in the manner that He prescribed and which pleases Him.\nوَءاتَيْنَـهُ فِى الْدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً\n(And We gave him good in this world,) meaning, `We granted him all that a believer may require for a good and complete life in this world.'\nوَإِنَّهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous.) Concerning the Ayah:\nوَءاتَيْنَـهُ فِى الْدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً\n(And We gave him good in this world,) Mujahid said: \"This means a truthful tongue.\"\nثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا\n(Then, We have sent the revelation to you: \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim (he was a) Hanif. ..) meaning, `because of his perfection, greatness, and the soundness of his Tawhid and his way, We revealed to you, O Seal of the Messengers and Leader of the Prophets ,'\nأَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(Follow the religion of Ibrahim (he was a) Hanif and he was not of the idolators.) This is like the Ayah in Surat Al-An`am:\nقُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَانِى رَبِّى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, (he was a) Hanif and he was not of the idolators.\") (6:161). Then Allah rebukes the Jews,"

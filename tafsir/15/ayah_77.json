    "text": "The Destruction of the Dwellers of Al-Aykah, the People of Shu`ayb\nThe Dwellers of Al-Aykah, were the people of Shu`ayb. Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others said that Al-Aykah refers to intertwined trees. Their evildoing included associating partners with Allah (Shirk), banditry and cheating in weights and measures. Allah punished them with the Sayhah (the awful cry or torment), the earthquake, and the torment of the Day of Shadow. They lived near the people of Lut, but at a later time, and the people of Lut were known to them, which is why Allah says,\nوَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(They are both on an open route, plain to see.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others said, \"a visible route.\" This is why, when Shu`ayb warned his people, he said to them,\nوَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِّنكُم بِبَعِيدٍ\n(And the people of Lut are not far off from you!) 11:89"

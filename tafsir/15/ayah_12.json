Allah said:\nرُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ\n(How much would those who disbelieved wish) Here Allah tells us that they will regret having lived in disbelief, and will wish that they had been Muslims in this world. Regarding Allah's saying,\nرُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ\n(How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Abi Az-Za`ra', from `Abdullah, who said: \"This is about the Jahannamiyyun (the sinners among the believers who will stay in Hell for some time), when they the disbelievers see them being brought out of Hell.\"\nرُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ\n(How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims.) Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas and Anas bin Malik explained that this Ayah refers to the Day when Allah will detain the sinful Muslims in Hell along with the idolators. He said: \"The idolators will say to them, `What you used to worship on earth has not helped you.' Then by virtue of His mercy, Allah will be angry for their sake, and He will remove them from it. That is when\nرُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ\n(How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims).\"\nذَرْهُمْ يَأْكُلُواْ وَيَتَمَتَّعُواْ\n(Leave them to eat and enjoy) this is a stern and definitive threat for them, like His saying,\nقُلْ تَمَتَّعُواْ فَإِنَّ مَصِيرَكُمْ إِلَى النَّارِ\n(Say: \"Enjoy your brief life! But certainly, your destination is the Fire!\") 14:30\nكُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ\n((O disbelievers!) Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the guilty.)77:46 Allah says:\nوَيُلْهِهِمُ الاٌّمَلُ\n(let them be preoccupied with false hope.) i.e., distracted from repentance and turning to Allah, for\nفَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(They will soon come to know!) that is, their punishment."

    "text": "The Response of Nuh\nAllah says, informing about the response of Nuh to his people,\nأَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى\n(Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord,) Bayyinah means certainty, a clear matter, and truthful prophethood. That is the greatest mercy from Allah upon him (Nuh) and them (his people).\nفَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(but that (mercy) has been obscured from your sight.) \"Obscured from your sight\" in this verse means, `it was hidden from you and you are not guided to it. Thus, you people did not know its importance so you hastily rejected and denied it.'\nأَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا\n(Shall we compel you (to accept) it) This means, \"Should we force you to accept it, while you actually detest it.\""

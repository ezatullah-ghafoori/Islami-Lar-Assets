    "text": "The Lesson taken from the Destroyed Towns\nWhen Allah mentioned the story of the Prophets and what happened with them and their nations -- how He destroyed the disbelievers and saved the believers -- He goes on to say,\nذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ الْقُرَى\n(That is some of the news of the (population of ) towns) meaning, news of them\nنَقُصُّهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنْهَا قَآئِمٌ\n(which We relate unto you; of them, some are (still) standing,) This means still remaining.\nوَحَصِيدٌ\n(and some have been (already) reaped.) This means totally destroyed.\nوَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ\n(We wronged them not,) This means, \"When We destroyed them.\"\nوَلَـكِن ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ\n(but they wronged themselves.) their rejecting their Messengers and disbelieving in them.\nفَمَا أَغْنَتْ عَنْهُمْ ءَالِهَتَهُمُ\n(So their gods, profited them not...) This is referring to their idols that they used to worship and invoke.\nمِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ\n(other than Allah naught) the idols did not benefit them, nor did they save them when Allah's com- mand came for their destruction.\nوَمَا زَادُوهُمْ غَيْرَ تَتْبِيبٍ\n(nor did they add aught to them but destruction.) Mujahid, Qatadah and others said, \"This means loss. Because the reason for their destruction and their ruin was that they followed those false gods. Therefore, they were losers in this life and the Hereafter.\""

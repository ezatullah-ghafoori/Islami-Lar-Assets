    "text": "Yusuf's Brothers accuse Him of Theft!\nAfter Yusuf's brothers saw that the king's bowl was taken out of Binyamin's bag, they said,\nإِن يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ\n(If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before.) They tried to show themselves as innocent from being like Binyamin, saying that he did just like a brother of his did beforehand, meaning Yusuf, peace be upon him! Allah said,\nفَأَسَرَّهَا يُوسُفُ فِى نَفْسِهِ\n(But these things did Yusuf keep in himself), meaning the statement that he said afterwards,\nأَنْتُمْ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمْ بِمَا تَصِفُونَ\n(You are in an evil situation, and Allah is the Best Knower of that which you describe!) Yusuf said this to himself and did not utter it aloud, thus intending to hide what he wanted to say to himself even before he said it. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,\nفَأَسَرَّهَا يُوسُفُ فِى نَفْسِهِ\n(But these things did Yusuf keep in himself), \"He kept in himself his statement next,\nأَنْتُمْ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمْ بِمَا تَصِفُونَ\n(You are in an evil situation, and Allah is the Best Knower of that which you describe!).\""

Obey the Messengers.\") -- he urged his people to follow the Messengers who had come to them.\nاتَّبِعُواْ مَن لاَّ يَسْـَلُكُمْ أَجْراً\n(Obey those who ask no wages of you,) means, `for the Message which they convey to you, and they are rightly-guided in what they are calling you to, the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate.'\nوَمَا لِىَ لاَ أَعْبُدُ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى\n(And why should I not worship Him Who has created me) means, `and what is there to stop me from sincerely worshipping the One Who has created me, and worshipping Him Alone, with no partner or associate'\nوَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(and to Whom you shall be returned.) means, `on the Day of Resurrection, when He will requite you for your deeds: if they are good then you will be rewarded and if they are evil then you will be punished.'\nأَءَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِهِ ءَالِهَةً\n(Shall I take besides Him gods) This is a rhetorical question intended to rebuke and chastise.\nإِن يُرِدْنِ الرَّحْمَـنُ بِضُرٍّ لاَّ تُغْنِ عَنِّى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُنقِذُونَ\n(If the Most Gracious intends me any harm, their intercession will be of no use for me whatsoever, nor can they save me.) means, `these gods whom you worship instead of Him possess no power whatsoever, if Allah wills me some harm,'\nفَلاَ كَـشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ\n(none can remove it but He) (6:17). `These idols can neither cause any harm nor bring any benefit, and they cannot save me from the predicament I am in.'\nإِنِّى إِذاً لَّفِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(Then verily, I should be in plain error.) means, `if I were to take them as gods instead of Allah.'\nإِنِّى ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَاسْمَعُونِ\n(Verily, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me!) Ibn Ishaq said, quoting from what had reached him from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Ka`b and Wahb, \"He said to his people:\nإِنِّى ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ\n(`Verily, I have believed in your Lord) in Whom you have disbelieved,\nفَاسْمَعُونِ\n(so listen to me!)' means, listen to what I say.\" Or it may be that he was addressing the Messengers when he said:\nإِنِّى ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ\n(Verily, I have believed in your Lord,) meaning, `Who has sent you,'\nفَاسْمَعُونِ\n(so listen to me!) meaning, `bear witness to that before Him.' This was narrated by Ibn Jarir, who said, \"And others said that this was addressed to the Messengers, and he said to them: `Listen to what I say and bear witness to what I say before my Lord, that I have believed in your Lord and have followed you.' This interpretation is more apparent, and Allah knows best. Ibn Ishaq said, quoting from what had reached him from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Ka`b and Wahb, `When he said that, they turned on him as one, and killed him at once, and he had no one to protect him from that.\"' Qatadah said, \"They started to stone him while he was saying, `O Allah, guide my people for they do not know, and they kept stoning him until he died a violent death, and he was still praying for them.' May Allah have mercy on him.\""

One of them said to his companion, `Ana Fatartuha,' meaning, `I started it.\"' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, also said,\nفَاطِرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Fatir of the heavens and the earth,) means, \"The Originator of the heavens and the earth.\" Ad-Dahhak said, \"Every time the phrase Fatir As-Samawati wal-Ard is used in the Qur'an, it means the Creator of the heavens and the earth.\"\nجَاعِلِ الْمَلَـئِكَةِ رُسُلاً\n(Who made the angels messengers) means, between Him and His Prophets.\nأُوْلِى أَجْنِحَةٍ\nwith wings means, with which they fly to convey quickly that which they have been commanded to convey.\nمَثْنَى وَثُلَـثَ وَرُبَاعَ\ntwo or three or four. means, among them are some who have two wings, some have three and some who have four. Some have more than that, as stated in the Hadith mentioning that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril (peace be upon him) on the Night of the Isra’ with six hundred wings. Between each pair of wings was a distance like that between the east and the west. Allah says:\nيَزِيدُ فِى الْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(He increases in creation what He wills. Verily, Allah is Able to do all things.) As-Suddi said, \"He increases their wings and creates them as He wills.\""

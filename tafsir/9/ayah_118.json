    "text": "After Allah mentioned the sins of the hypocrites, He praised the faithful believers and described their reward in the Hereafter,\nلَـكِنِ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ جَـهَدُواْ\n(But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove hard and fought) until the end of these two Ayat 9:88-89. This describes the qualities, as well as, the reward of faithful believers. Allah said,\nوَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ الْخَيْرَاتُ\n(Such are they for whom are the good things), in the Hereafter, in the gardens of Al-Firdaws and the high grades."

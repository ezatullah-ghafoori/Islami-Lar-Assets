    "text": "Exposing the Deceitful Ways of Hypocrites\nAllah said that when the believers go back to Al-Madinah, the hypocrites will begin apologizing to them.\nقُل لاَّ تَعْتَذِرُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكُمْ\n(Say \"Present no excuses, we shall not believe you.\"), we shall not believe what you say,\nقَدْ نَبَّأَنَا اللَّهُ مِنْ أَخْبَارِكُمْ\n(Allah has already informed us of the news concerning you.) Allah has exposed your news to us,\nوَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ\n(Allah and His Messenger will observe your deeds.) your actions will be made public to people in this life,\nثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَـلِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(In the end you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He (Allah) will inform you of what you used to do.) Allah will inform you of your deeds, whether they were good or evil, and will recompense you for them. Allah said that the hypocrites will swear to the believers in apology, so that the believers turn away from them without admonishing them. Therefore, Allah ordered disgracing them by turning away from them, for they are,\nرِجْسٌ\n(Rijs) meaning, impure inwardly and in their creed. Their destination in the end will be Jahannam,\nجَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ\n(a recompense for that which they used to earn.) of sins and evil deeds. Allah said that if the believers forgive the hypocrites when they swear to them,\nفَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَرْضَى عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْفَـسِقِينَ\n(certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are Fasiqin.) who rebel against the obedience of Allah and His Messenger . `Fisq', means, `deviation'."

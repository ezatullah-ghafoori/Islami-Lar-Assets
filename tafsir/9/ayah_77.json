    "text": "Allah emphasizes the enmity that the hypocrites have for the Prophet\nIf a blessing, such as victory and triumph over the enemies, is given to the Prophet , thus pleasing him and his Companions, it grieves the hypocrites,\nوَإِن تُصِبْكَ مُصِيبَةٌ يَقُولُواْ قَدْ أَخَذْنَا أَمْرَنَا مِن قَبْلُ\n(but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: \"We took our precaution beforehand,\"), they say, we took precautions when we did not join him,\nوَيَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُمْ فَرِحُونَ\n(and they turn away rejoicing.) Allah directed His Prophet to reply to the perfect enmity they have towards him,\nقُلْ\n(Say), to them,\nلَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَنَا\n(Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us.) for we are under His control and decree,\nهُوَ مَوْلَـنَا\n(He is our Mawla.), Master and protector,\nوَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ\n(And in Allah let the believers put their trust) 9:51, and we trust in Him. Verily, He is sufficient for us and what an excellent guardian."

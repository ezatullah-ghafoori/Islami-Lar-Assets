    "text": "Other Characteristics of Hypocrites\nAllah admonishes the hypocrites who, unlike the believers, who enjoin righteousness and forbid evil,\nيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمُنكَرِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَقْبِضُونَ أَيْدِيَهُمْ\n(they enjoin evil, and forbid the good, and they close their hands), from spending in Allah's cause,\nنَسُواْ اللَّهَ\n(They have forgotten Allah), they have forgotten the remembrance of Allah,\nفَنَسِيَهُمْ\n(so He has forgotten them.), by treating them as if He has forgotten them. Allah also,\nوَقِيلَ الْيَوْمَ نَنسَاكُمْ كَمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَا\n(And it will be said: \"This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours) 45:34. Allah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ هُمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ\n(Verily, the hypocrites are the rebellious) the rebellious from the way of truth who embrace the wicked way,\nوَعَدَ الله الْمُنَـفِقِينَ وَالْمُنَـفِقَاتِ وَالْكُفَّارَ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ\n(Allah has promised the hypocrites -- men and women -- and the disbelievers, the fire of Hell), on account of their evildoing mentioned here,\nخَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ\n(therein shall they abide.), for eternity, they and the disbelievers,\nهِىَ حَسْبُهُمْ\n(It will suffice them.), as a torment,\nوَلَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ\n(Allah has cursed them), He expelled and banished them from His mercy,\nوَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ\n(and for them is the lasting torment.)"

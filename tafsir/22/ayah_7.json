    "text": "The Reward of the Righteous\nThe mention of the misguided who are doomed is followed by mention of the righteous who are blessed. They are those who believe firmly in their hearts and confirm their faith by their actions, doing all kinds of righteous deeds and avoiding evil actions. Because of this, they will inherit dwellings in the lofty ranks of the gardens of Paradise. So Allah tells us that He sends those astray and guides these, and says:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ\n(Verily, Allah does what He wills.)"

    "text": "Good News of Allah's Defence for the Believers\nHere Allah tells us that He defends His servants who put their trust in Him and turn to Him in repentance; He protects them from the the worst of evil people and the plots of the sinners; He protects them, guards them and supports them, as He tells us elsewhere:\nأَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُ\n(Is not Allah sufficient for His servant) 39:36\nوَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things) 65:3.\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ خَوَّانٍ كَفُورٍ\n(Verily, Allah likes not any treacherous ingrate) means, He does not like any of His servants who bear these characteristics, i.e., treachery in covenants and promises whereby a person does not do what he says, and ingratitude is to deny the blessings, whereby one does not acknowledge or appreciate them."

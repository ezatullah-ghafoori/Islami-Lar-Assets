    "text": "The insignificance of the Idols and the foolishness of their Worshippers\nHere Allah points out the insignificance of the idols and the foolishness of those who worship them.\nيأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ضُرِبَ مَثَلٌ\n(O mankind! A parable has been made,) meaning, a parable of that which is worshipped by those who are ignorant of Allah and who join others as partners with Him.\nفَاسْتَمِعُواْ لَهُ\n(so listen to it) pay attention and understand.\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُواْ ذُبَاباً وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُواْ لَهُ\n(Verily, those on whom you call besides Allah, cannot create a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose.) Even if all the idols and false gods whom you worship were to come together to create a single fly, they would not be able to do that. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah recorded the Marfu` report:\n«وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ (خَلْقًا) كَخَلْقِي، فَلْيَخْلُقُوا مِثْلَ خَلْقِي ذَرَّةً أَوْ ذُبَابَةً أَوْ حَبَّة»\n(\"Who does more wrong than one who tries to create something like My creation Let them create an ant or a fly or a seed like My creation!\") This was also recorded by the authors of the Two Sahihs via `Umarah from Abu Zur`ah from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet said: a\n«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ ذَهَبَ يَخْلُقُ كَخَلْقِي، فَلْيَخْلُقُوا ذَرَّةً، فَلْيَخْلُقُوا شَعِيرَة»\n(Allah says: \"Who does more wrong than one who tries to create (something) like My creation Let them create an ant, let them create a grain of barley.\") Then Allah says:\nوَإِن يَسْلُبْهُمُ الذُّبَابُ شَيْئاً لاَّ يَسْتَنقِذُوهُ مِنْهُ\n(And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly.) They are unable to create a single fly and, moreover, they are unable to resist it or take revenge against it if it were to take anything from the good and perfumed thing on which it lands. If they wanted to recover that, they would not be able to, even though the fly is the weakest and most insignificant of Allah's creatures. Allah says:\nضَعُفَ الطَّالِبُ وَالْمَطْلُوبُ\n(So weak are the seeker and the sought.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"The seeker is the idol and the sought is the fly.\" This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and it is what is apparent from the context. As-Suddi and others said, \"The seeker is the worshipper, and the sought is the idol.\" Then Allah says:\nمَا قَدَرُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ\n(They have not regarded Allah with His rightful esteem.) meaning, they have not recognized the might and power of Allah when they wor- ship alongside Him those who cannot even ward off a fly, because they are so weak and incapable.\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Verily, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.) means, He is the All-Strong Who, by His might and power, created all things.\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him) 30:27\nإِنَّ بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ لَشَدِيدٌ - إِنَّهُ هُوَ يُبْدِىءُ وَيُعِيدُ\n(Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful. Verily, He it is Who begins and repeats.) 85:12-13\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ\n(Verily, Allah is the Provider, Owner of power, the Most Strong.) 51:58.\nعَزِيزٌ\n(All-Mighty) means, He has subjugated and subdued all things, and there is none that can resist Him or overcome His might and power, and He is the One, the Subduer."

Then we were given power in the land, so we established regular prayer, paid the Zakah, enjoined what is good and forbade what is evil, and with Allah rests the end of (all) matters. This is about my companions and I.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"They were the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ.\" As-Sabah bin Suwadah Al-Kindi said, \"I heard `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz give a speech and say:\nالَّذِينَ إِنْ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Those who, if We give them power in the land....) Then he said, \"This is not obligatory only for those who are in authority, it also applies to those who are governed by them. Shall I not tell you what you can expect from your governor, and what duties those who are ruled owe to him Your rights over your governor are that he should check on you with regard to your duties towards Allah and restore the rights that you have over one another, and that he should guide you to the straight path as much as possible. Your duties towards him are that you should obey him without cheating and without resentment, and you should obey him both in secret and openly.\" `Atiyah Al-`Awfi said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah:\nوَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ\n(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land) 24:55.\nوَلِلَّهِ عَـقِبَةُ الاٍّمُورِ\n(And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters.) This is like the Ayah:\nوَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa) 28:83. Zayd bin Aslam said:\nوَلِلَّهِ عَـقِبَةُ الاٍّمُورِ\n(And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters.) \"And with Allah will be the reward for what they did.\""

Ad-Dahhak said, \"It is an idol which they used to worship.\"\nأَتَدْعُونَ بَعْلاً\n(Will you call upon Ba`l) means, `will you worship an idol,'\nأَتَدْعُونَ بَعْلاً وَتَذَرُونَ أَحْسَنَ الْخَـلِقِينَ - اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ وَرَبَّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(and forsake the Best of creators, Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers) means, `He is the One Who is deserving of your worship alone, with no partners or associates.'\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ\n(But they denied him, so they will certainly be brought forth,) means, for the punishment on the Day of Reckoning.\nإِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ\n(Save the chosen servants of Allah.) means, those who believe in Him alone.\nوَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى الاٌّخِرِينَ\n(And We left for him among the later generations.) means, he is praised and spoken of highly.\nسَلَـمٌ عَلَى إِلْ يَاسِينَ\n(Salam (peace!) be upon Ilyasin!) Similarly, one might say for Isma`il, Isma`in. This is the language (dialect) of Bani Asad; they say Mikal, Mika'il, and Mika'in. They say Ibrahim and Ibraham; Isra'il, Isra'in; Tur Sina', Tur Sinin. All of that is fine.\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ - إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good. Verily, he was one of Our believing servants.) We have already discussed the meaning of this above. And Allah knows best."

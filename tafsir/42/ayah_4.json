    "text": "Allah is the Protector, Ruler and Creator\nHere Allah denounces the idolators for taking other gods instead of Allah, and declares that He is the True God, and it is not right to worship anyone except Him Alone. He is the One Who is able to bring the dead back to life and He is Able to do all things. Then He says:\nوَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ\n(And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah.) means, in whatever issue you differ. This is general in meaning and applies to all things.\nفَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ\n(the decision thereof is with Allah.) means, He is the Judge of that, according to His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet . This is like the Ayah:\nفَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ\n((And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger) (4:59).\nذَلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبِّى\n(Such is Allah, my Lord) means, (He is) the Judge of all things.\nعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ\n(in Whom I put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance. ) means, `I refer all matters to Him.'\nفَاطِرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(The Creator of the heavens and the earth.) means, the Maker of them both and everything in between.\nجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا\n(He has made for you mates from yourselves,) means, of your own kind. As a blessing and a favor from Him, He has made your kind male and female.\nوَمِنَ الاٌّنْعَـمِ أَزْوجاً\n(and for the cattle (also) mates.) means, and He has created for you eight pairs of cattle.\nيَذْرَؤُكُمْ فِيهِ\n(By this means He creates you.) means, in this manner He creates you, male and female, generation after generation of men and cattle.\nلَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَىْءٌ\n(There is nothing like Him,) means, there is nothing like the Creator of these pairs, for He is the Unique, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who has no peer or equal.\nوَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ\n(He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.)\nلَهُ مَقَـلِيدُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. ) We have already discussed the interpretation of this phrase in Surat Az-Zumar (39:63), the conclusion of which is that He is the One Who is controlling and governing them.\nيَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَنْ يَشَآءُ وَيَقَدِرُ\n(He expands provision for whom He wills, and straitens.) means, He gives plentiful provision to whomsoever He wills and He reduces it for whomsoever He wills, and He is perfectly Wise and Just.\nإِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ\n(Verily, He is the All-Knower of everything.)"

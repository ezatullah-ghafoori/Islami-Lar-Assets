He took along the Tablets, after his anger subsided, and commanded them to adhere to the orders that Allah ordained to be delivered to them. But these orders became heavy on them and they did not want to implement them until Allah raised the mountain over them,\nكَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ\n(as if it had been a canopy), that is, when the angels raised the mountain over their heads.\" An-Nasa'i collected it."

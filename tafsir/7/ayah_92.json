    "text": "وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَآ\n(And of those whom We have created), in reference to some nations,\nأُمَّةٍ\n(a community), that stands in truth, in words and action,\nيَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(who guides (others) with the truth), they proclaim it and call to it,\nوَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ\n(and establishes justice therewith), adhere to it themselves and judge by it. It was reported that this Ayah refers to the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَة»\n(There will always be a group of my Ummah who are apparent on the Truth, unabated by those who fail or oppose them, until the (Last) Hour commences.) rIn another narration, the Messenger  ﷺ said,\n«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ عَلَى ذَلِك»\n(Until Allah's command (the Last Hour) comes while they are still like this. ) and in yet another narration,\n«وَهُمْ بِالشَّام»\n(And they will dwell in Ash-Sham (Greater Syria).)"

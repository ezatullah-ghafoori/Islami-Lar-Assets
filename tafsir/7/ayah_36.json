    "text": "Fir`awn and His People suffer Years of Drought\nAllah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَآ ءالَ فِرْعَوْنَ\n(And indeed We punished the people of Fir`awn) We tested and tried them,\nبِالسِّنِينَ\n(with years of drought) of famine due to little produce,\nوَنَقْصٍ مِّن الثَّمَرَاتِ\n(and lack of fruits), which is less severe, according to Mujahid. Abu Ishaq narrated that Raja' bin Haywah said, \"The date tree used to produce only one date!\"\nلَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَفَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ الْحَسَنَةُ\n(That they might remember (take heed). But whenever good came to them) such as a fertile season and provisions,\nقَالُواْ لَنَا هَـذِهِ\n(they said, \"This is for us.\"), because we deserve it,\nوَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ\n(and if evil afflicted them) drought and famine,\nيَطَّيَّرُواْ بِمُوسَى وَمَن مَّعَهُ\n(they considered it an omen Musa and those with him. ) saying that this hardship is because of them and what they have done.\nأَلاَ إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(Verily, their omens are with Allah) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,\nأَلاَ إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(Verily, their omens are with Allah) \"Allah says that their afflictions are with and from Him,\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(but most of them know not.)\""

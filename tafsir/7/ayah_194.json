    "text": "Allah describes the way the disbelievers answered His ProphetShu` ayb and those who believed in him, by threatening them withexpulsion from their village, or with forceful reversion to thedisbeliever's religion.\nThe chiefs spoke the words mentioned here to the Messenger Shu`ayb, but intended it for those who followed his religion too. The statement,\nأَوَلَوْ كُنَّا كَـرِهِينَ\n(\"Even though we hate it\"), means, would you force us to do that, even though we hate what you are calling us to Certainly if we revert to your religion and accept your ways, we will have uttered a tremendous lie against Allah by calling partners as rivals to Him,\nوَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّعُودَ فِيهَآ إِلاَ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ رَبُّنَا\n(And it is not for us to return to it unless Allah, our Lord, should will.) This part of the Ayah refers all matters to Allah's will, and certainly, He has perfect knowledge of all matters and His observation encompasses all things,\nعَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا\n(In Allah (Alone) we put our trust. ), concerning all our affairs, what we practice of them and what we ignore,\nرَبَّنَا افْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِالْحَقِّ\n(Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth) judge between us and our people and give us victory over them,\nوَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الْفَـتِحِينَ\n(for You are the best of those who give judgment) and You are the Most Just Who never wrongs any in His judgment."

Allah mentioned their end again in Suah Hud,\nوَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْبًا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِى دِيَـرِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ\n(And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the Sayhah (loud cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (dead) prostrate in their homes.) 11:94 This Ayah mentions the Sayhah (cry) that struck them after they mocked Shu`ayb, saying,\nأَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ\n(Does your Salah (prayer) command you...) so it was befitting to mention here the cry that made them silence. In Surat Ash-Shu`ara', Allah said,\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(But they belied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day) 26:189 because they challenged Shu`ayb,\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(\"So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!\") 26:187. Therefore, Allah stated that each of these forms of punishment struck them on the Day of the Shadow. First,\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ\n(So the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them) 26:189 when a gloomy cloud came over them (containing) fire, flames and a tremendous light. Next, a cry from the sky descended on them and a tremor shook them from beneath. Consequently, their souls were captured, their lives were taken and their bodies became idle,\nفَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ\n(and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes). Allah said next,\nكَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ\n(They became as if they had never dwelt there) meaning, after the torment seized them, it looked as if they never dwelled in the land from which they wanted to expel their Messenger Shu`ayb and his followers. Here, Allah refuted their earlier statement,\nالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْبًا كَانُواْ هُمُ الْخَـسِرِينَ\n(Those who belied Shu`ayb, they were the losers.)"

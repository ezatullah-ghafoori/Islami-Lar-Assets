    "text": "Story of Shu`ayb, upon him be Peace, and the Land of Madyan\nMuhammad bin Ishaq said, \"They (the people of Madyan) are the descendents of Madyan, son of Midyan, son of Ibrahim. Shu`ayb was the son of Mikil bin Yashjur. And in the Syrian language, his name was Yathrun (Jethro)\". I (Ibn Kathir) say, Madyan was the name of the tribe and also a city that is close to Ma`an on route to the Hijaz (from Ash-Sham). Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 They are also the people of Al-Aykah (the Woods), as we will mention later on, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him.\nقَالَ يَاقَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ\n(He said: \"O my people!

He then advised them and commanded them to give full measure and full weight and not to wrong men in their dealings, meaning, to refrain from cheating people in buying and selling. They used to treacherously avoid giving full weight and measure. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ\n(Woe to Al-Mutaffifin (those who give less in measure and weight)...) 83:1 until He said,\nلِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(before the Lord of all that exists) 83:6.

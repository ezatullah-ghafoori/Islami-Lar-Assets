    "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nكِتَـبٌ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ\n((This is the) Book (the Qur'an) sent down unto you (O Muhammad)), from your Lord,\nفَلاَ يَكُن فِى صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِّنْهُ\n(so let not your breast be narrow therefrom,) meaning, having doubt about it according to Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi. It was also said that the meaning here is: `do not hesitate to convey the Qur'an and warn with it,'\nفَاصْبِرْ كَمَا صَبَرَ أُوْلُواْ الْعَزْمِ مِنَ الرُّسُلِ\n(Therefore be patient as did the Messengers of strong will) 46:35. Allah said here,\nلِتُنذِرَ بِهِ\n(that you warn thereby) meaning, `We sent down the Qur'an so that you may warn the disbelievers with it,'\nوَذِكْرَى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(and a reminder unto the believers). Allah then said to the world,\nاتَّبِعُواْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ\n(Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord) meaning, follow and imitate the unlettered Prophet , who brought you a Book that was revealed for you, from the Lord and master of everything.\nوَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ\n(and follow not any Awliya', besides Him (Allah)) meaning, do not disregard what the Messenger brought you and follow something else, for in this case, you will be deviating from Allah's judgment to the decision of someone else. Allah's statement,\nقَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ\n(Little do you remember!) is similar to,\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly)12:103, and;\nوَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ\n(And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah's path)6:116, and,\nوَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ بِاللَّهِ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ مُّشْرِكُونَ\n(And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him)12:106."

    "text": "The People of Al-A`raf\nAfter Allah mentioned that the people of Paradise will address the people of the Fire, He stated that there is a barrier between Paradise and the Fire, which prevents the people of the Fire from reaching Paradise. Ibn Jarir said, \"It is the wall that Allah described,\nفَضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُم بِسُورٍ لَّهُ بَابٌ بَاطِنُهُ فِيهِ الرَّحْمَةُ وَظَـهِرُهُ مِن قِبَلِهِ الْعَذَابُ\n(So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.) 57:13 It is also about Al-A`raf that Allah said,\nوَعَلَى الاٌّعْرَافِ رِجَالٌ\n(and on Al-A`raf will be men).\" Ibn Jarir recorded that As-Suddi said about Allah's statement,\nوَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ\n(And between them will be a screen) \"It is the wall, it is Al-A`raf.\" Mujahid said, \"Al-A`raf is a barrier between Paradise and the Fire, a wall that has a gate.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"Al-A`raf is plural for `Urf, where every elevated piece of land is known as `Urf to the Arabs.\" As-Suddi said, \"Al-A`raf is so named because its residents recognize (Ya`rifun) the people. Al-A`raf's residents are those whose good and bad deeds are equal, as Hudhayfah, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and several of the Salaf and later generations said.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Hudhayfah was asked about the people of Al-A`raf and he said, \"A people whose good and bad deeds are equal. Their evil deeds prevented them from qualifying to enter Paradise, and their good deeds qualified them to avoid the Fire. Therefore, they are stopped there on the wall until Allah judges them.\" Ma`mar said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,\nلَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ\n(and at that time they will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but they will hope to enter (it).) Then he said, \"By Allah! Allah did not put this hope in their hearts, except for an honor that He intends to bestow on them.\" Qatadah said; \"Those who hope are those among you whom Allah informed of their places.\" Allah said next,\nوَإِذَا صُرِفَتْ أَبْصَـرُهُمْ تِلْقَآءَ أَصْحَـبِ النَّارِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(And when their eyes will be turned towards the dwellers of the Fire, they will say: \"Our Lord! Place us not with the people who are wrongdoers.\") Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the people of Al-A`raf look at the people of the Fire and recognize them, they will supplicate, `O Lord! Do not place us with the people who are wrongdoers.\"'\nوَنَادَى أَصْحَـبُ الاٌّعْرَافِ رِجَالاً يَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِسِيمَـهُمْ قَالُواْ مَآ أَغْنَى عَنكُمْ جَمْعُكُمْ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ"

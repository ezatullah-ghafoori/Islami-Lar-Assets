    "text": "The Final Return of the Blessed\nAllah tells us that His blessed, believing servants will have a good final return in the Hereafter, which means their ultimate destination. Then He explains it further, as He says:\nجَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ\n(`Adn Gardens) meaning, eternal gardens (of Paradise),\nمُّفَتَّحَةً لَّهُمُ الاٌّبْوَابُ\n(whose doors will be opened for them.) means, when they come to them (these gardens), their gates will open for them.\nمُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا\n(Therein they will recline;) It was said that this means that they will sit cross-legged on chairs beneath canopies.\nيَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ\n(therein they will call for fruits in abundance) means, whatever they ask for, they will find it, and it will be prepared just as they wanted it.\nوَشَرَابٌ\n(and drinks;) means, whatever kind of drink they want, the servants will bring it to them,\nبِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ\n(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine.) (56: 18).\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat-at-Tarf (chaste females)) means, they restrain their glances from anyone except their husbands, and do not turn to anyone else.\nأَتْرَابٌ\n((and) of equal ages.) means, they will all be of the same age. This is the understanding of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b and As-Suddi.\nهَـذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِيَوْمِ الْحِسَابِ\n(This it is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning!) means, `this that We have mentioned of the features of Paradise is what He has prepared for His pious servants who will reach it after they have been resurrected from their graves and been saved from the Fire.' Then Allah tells us that Paradise will never come to an end or disappear or cease to be. He says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَرِزْقُنَا مَا لَهُ مِن نَّفَادٍ\n(Verily, this is Our provision which will never finish.) This is like the Ayat:\nمَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ\n(Whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain) (16:96).\nعَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ\n(a gift without an end.) (11:108)\nلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ\n(for them is a reward that will never come to an end.) (84:25).\nأُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وِظِلُّهَا تِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّعُقْبَى الْكَـفِرِينَ النَّارُ\n(its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.)(13:35). And there are many similar Ayat."

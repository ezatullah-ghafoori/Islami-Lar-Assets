    "text": "Learning the Lessons of the Past\nAllah says: will these people who deny the Messengers not learn from the nations who came before them, whom Allah destroyed for their rejection of His Messengers and their opposition to what the Messengers brought them of the straight path No trace is left of them whatsoever.\nهَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزاً\n(Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them) (19:98). Allah says:\nيَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَـكِنِهِمْ\n(in whose dwellings they do walk about) meaning, these disbelievers walk about in the places where those disbelievers used to live, but they do not see any of those who used to live there, for they have gone --\nكَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ\n(As if they had never lived there) (11:68) This is like the Ayat:\nفَتِلْكَ بُيُوتُهُمْ خَاوِيَةً بِمَا ظَلَمُواْ\n(These are their houses in utter ruin, for they did wrong) (27:52).\nفَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا وَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ وَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(And many a township did We destroy while they were given to wrongdoing, so that it lie in ruins, and (many) a deserted well and lofty castle! Have they not traveled through the land) until:\nوَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ\n(but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) (22:45-46) Allah says here:\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاّيَاتٍ\n(Verily, therein indeed are signs.) meaning, in the fact that these people are gone and have been destroyed, and in what happened to them because they disbelieved the Messengers, and how those who believed in them were saved, there are many signs, proofs and important lessons.\nأَفَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ\n(Would they not then listen) means, to the stories of those who came before and what happened to them. n\nThe Revival of the Earth with Water is Proof of the Resurrection to come\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ الْمَآءَ إِلَى الاٌّرْضِ الْجُرُزِ\n(Have they not seen how We drive water to the dry land) Here Allah explains His kindness and goodness towards them by His sending water to them, whether from the sky or from water flowing through the land, water carried by rivers down from the mountains to the lands that need it at particular times. Allah says:\nإِلَى الاٌّرْضِ الْجُرُزِ\n(to the dry land) which means the land where nothing grows, as in the Ayah,\nوَإِنَّا لَجَاعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيداً جُرُزاً\n(And verily, We shall make all that is on it a bare dry soil.) (18:8) i.e., barren land where nothing grows. Allah says here:\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ الْمَآءَ إِلَى الاٌّرْضِ الْجُرُزِ فَنُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعاً تَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ أَنْعَـمُهُمْ وَأَنفُسُهُمْ أَفَلاَ يُبْصِرُونَ\n(Have they not seen how We drive water to the dry land that has no vegetation, and therewith bring forth crops providing food for their cattle and themselves Will they not then see) This is like the Ayah,\nفَلْيَنظُرِ الإِنسَـنُ إِلَى طَعَامِهِ أَنَّا صَبَبْنَا الْمَآءَ صَبّاً\n(Then let man look at his food: We pour forth water in abundance.) (80:24-25).  Allah says here:\nأَفَلاَ يُبْصِرُونَ\n(Will they not then see)"

    "text": "Which was revealed in Al-Madinah\nThe Virtues of Surah Alif Lam Mim As-Sajdah\nIn the Book of the Friday prayer, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet used to recite in Fajr on Fridays:\nالم تَنزِيلَ\n(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of...), As-Sajdah, and\nهَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ\n(Has there not been over man...)Al-Insan (76).\" This was also recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said, \"The Prophet would never sleep until he recited:\nالم تَنزِيلَ\n(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of...), As-Sajdah, and\nتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ\n(Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion) Al-Mulk (67).\"\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an is the Book of Allah in which there is no Doubt\nWe discussed the individual letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and there is no need to repeat it here.\nتَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ\n(The revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,) means, there is no doubt whatsoever that it has been revealed\nمِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(from the Lord of all that exists.) Then Allah tells us about the idolators:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ\n(Or say they: \"He has fabricated it\"): they say, he has fabricated it, i.e., he has made it up by himself.\nبَلْ هُوَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ\n(Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.) means, in order that they may follow the truth."

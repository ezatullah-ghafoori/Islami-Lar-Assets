    "text": "The Virtues of the Surahs that begin with Ha Mim\nIbn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Everything has an essence and the essence of the Qur'an is the family of Ha Mim,\" or he said, \"the Ha Mims.\" Mis`ar bin Kidam said, \"They used to be called `the brides'.\" All of this was recorded by the the Imam, great scholar, Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam, may Allah have mercy upon him, in his book Fada'il Al-Qur'an. Humayd bin Zanjuyah narrated that `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The parable of the Qur'an is that of a man who sets out to find a place for his family to stay, and he comes to a place where there is evidence of rainfall. While he is walking about, admiring it, he suddenly comes upon beautiful gardens. He says, `I liked the first traces of rainfall, but this is far better.' It was said to him, `The first place is like the Qur'an, and these beautiful gardens are like the splendor of family of Ha Mim in relation to the rest of the Qur'an'.\" This was recorded by Al-Baghawi. Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When I reach the family of Ha Mim, it is like reaching a beautiful garden, so I take my time.\"\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n«إِنْ بُيِّتُّمُ اللَّيْلَةَ فَقُولُوا: حم لَا يُنْصَرُون»\n(When you go to bed tonight, recite Ha Mim, La Yunsarun.)\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih.\nتَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ\n(The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Almighty, the All-Knower.) means, this book -- the Qur'an -- is from Allah, the Owner of might and knowledge, Who cannot be overtaken and from Whom nothing is hidden, not even an ant concealed beneath many layers.\nغَافِرِ الذَّنبِ وَقَابِلِ التَّوْبِ\n(The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance,) means, He forgives sins that have been committed in the past, and He accepts repentance for sins that may be committed in the future, from the one who repents and submits to Him.\nشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n(the Severe in punishment,) means, to the one who persists in transgression and prefers the life of this world, who stubbornly turns away from the commands of Allah and commits sin. This is like the Ayah:\nنَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ - وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ ٱلْعَذَابُ ٱلْأَلِيمُ\n(Declare unto My servants that truly I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) (15:49-50). These two attributes (mercy and punishment) are often mentioned together in the Qur'an, so that people will remain in a state of both hope and fear.\nذِى الطَّوْلِ\n(the Bestower.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"This means He is Generous and Rich (Independent of means).\" The meaning is that He is Most Generous to His servants, granting ongoing blessings for which they can never sufficiently thank Him.\nوَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا\n(And if you would count the favors of Allah, never could you be able to count them...) (16:18).\nلاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ\n(La ilaha illa Huwa) means, there is none that is equal to Him in all His attributes; there is no God or Lord besides Him.\nإِلَيْهِ الْمَصِيرُ\n(to Him is the final return.) means, all things will come back to Him and He will reward or punish each person according to his deeds.\nوَهُوَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ\n(and He is Swift at reckoning) (13:41)."

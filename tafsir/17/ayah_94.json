    "text": "Turning away from Allah at Times of Ease and despairing at Times of Calamity\nAllah tells us about the weakness that is inherent in man, except for those whom He protects at both times of ease and calamity. If Allah blesses a man with wealth, good health, ease, provision and help, and he gets what he wants, he turns away from the obedience and worship of Allah, and becomes arrogant. Mujahid said, \"(It means) he goes away from Us.\" I say, this is like the Ayah:\nفَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُ ضُرَّهُ مَرَّ كَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَى ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ\n(But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) 10:12 and;\nفَلَمَّا نَجَّـكُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ\n(But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away.) When man is stricken with evil, which means disasters, accidents and calamities,\nكَانَ يَئُوساً\n(he is in great despair.), meaning that he thinks he will never have anything good again. As Allah says,\nوَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا الإِنْسَـنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَاهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُ لَيَئُوسٌ كَفُورٌ - وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَاهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ السَّيِّئَاتُ عَنِّي إِنَّهُ لَفَرِحٌ فَخُورٌ - إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ\n(And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us, and remove it from him, verily, He is despairing, ungrateful. But if We let him taste good after evil has touched him, he is sure to say: \"Ills have departed from me.\" Surely, he is exultant, and boastful. Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds: those, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.) (11:9-11)\nقُلْ كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَى شَاكِلَتِهِ\n(Say: \"Each one does according to Shakilatihi...\") Ibn `Abbas said, \"According to his inclinations.\" Mujahid said, \"According to his inclinations and his nature.\" Qatadah said, \"According to his intentions.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"According to his religion.\" All these suggestions are close in meaning. This Ayah - and Allah knows best - is a threat and a warning to the idolators, like the Ayah:\nوَقُل لِّلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ اعْمَلُواْ عَلَى مَكَانَتِكُمْ\n(And say to those who do not believe: \"Act according to your ability and way\") (11:121) So Allah says:\nقُلْ كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَى شَاكِلَتِهِ فَرَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنْ هُوَ أَهْدَى سَبِيلاً\n(Say: \"Each one does according to Shakilatihi, and your Lord knows best of him whose path is right.\") meaning either us or you. Everyone will be rewarded in accordance with his deeds, for nothing whatsoever is hidden from Allah."

    "text": "The Destruction or Torment of all Disbelieving Towns before the Hour begins\nHere Allah tells us that He has decreed and it is written in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet) which is with Him, that there is no town that He will not destroy by wiping out all its people or by punishing them,\nعَذَاباً شَدِيداً\n(with a severe torment.) either by killing them or sending calamities upon them as He wills. This will be because of their sins, as Allah says of the past nations:\nوَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ\n(We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.) 11:101\nفَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً\n(So it tasted the evil result of its affair (disbelief), and the consequence of its affair (disbelief) was loss.) 65:9\nوَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ\n(And many a town (population) revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;) 65:8 and many Ayat."

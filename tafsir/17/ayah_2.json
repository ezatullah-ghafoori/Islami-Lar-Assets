It directs people to the best and clearest of ways.\nوَيُبَشِّرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(gives good news to those who believe,) in it a\nالَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ الصَّـلِحَاتِ\n(those who do righteous deeds,) in accordance with it, telling them\nأَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا كَبِيرًا\n(that they will have a great reward,) i.e., on the Day of Resurrection. And He tells\nوأَنَّ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ\n(those who do not believe in the Hereafter,) that\nلَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً\n(for them is a painful torment,) i.e. on the Day of Resurrection. As Allah says:\nفَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(... then announce to them a painful torment.) 84:24"

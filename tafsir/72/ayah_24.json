    "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\n(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Jinns listening to the Qur'an and Their Belief in It\nAllah commands His Messenger to inform his people that the Jinns listened to the Qur'an, believed in it, affirmed its truthfulness and adhered to it. So Allah says,\nقُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَقَالُواْ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْءَانَاً عَجَباً يَهْدِى إِلَى الرُّشْدِ\n(Say: \"It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened. They said: `Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation! It guides to the right path\"') meaning, to what is correct and success.\nفَـَامَنَّا بِهِ وَلَن نُّشرِكَ بِرَبِّنَآ أَحَداً\n(and we have believed therein, and we shall never join anything with our Lord.) This position (that they took) is similar to what Allah said,\nوَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ\n(And when We sent towards you a group of the Jinns listening to the Qur'an.) (46:29) We have already presented the Hadiths that have been narrated concerning this, so there is no need to repeat them here. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَأَنَّهُ تَعَـلَى جَدُّ رَبِّنَا\n(And He, exalted be the Jadd of our Lord,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning Allah's statement,\nجَدُّ رَبِّنَا\n(the Jadd of our Lord,) \"This means, His actions, His commands and His power.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Allah's Jadd is His blessings, His power and His favor upon His creation.\" It has been reported from Mujahid and `Ikrimah that they said, \"It (Jadd) is the magnificence of our Lord.\" Qatadah said, \"Exalted is His magnificence, His greatness and His command.\" As-Suddi said, \"Exalted is the command of our Lord.\" It has been reported from Abu Ad-Darda', Mujahid and Ibn Jurayj that they said, \"Exalted is His remembrance (Dhikr).\"\nThe Jinns Affirmation that Allah does not have a Wife and Children\nAllah says,\nمَا اتَّخَذَ صَـحِبَةً وَلاَ وَلَداً\n(He has taken neither a wife nor a son.) meaning, far exalted is He above taking a mate and having children. This means that when the Jinns accepted Islam and believed in the Qur'an they professed Allah's magnificence above having taken a spouse and a child (or a son). Then they said,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى اللَّهِ شَطَطاً\n(And that the foolish among us used to utter against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said,\nسَفِيهُنَا\n(the foolish among us) \"They were referring to Iblis.\"\nشَطَطًا\n(that which was an enormity in falsehood.) As-Suddi reported from Abu Malik that he said, \"This means a transgression.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"A great injustice.\" The foolish (Safih) also carries the meaning of everyone in the category who claims that Allah has a spouse or a son. This is why Allah says here,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا\n(And that the foolish among us used to utter) meaning, nd He, eeA ? The Jinns Affirmation that Allah does not have a Wife and Children Allah says,\nمَا اتَّخَذَ صَـحِبَةً وَلاَ وَلَداً\n(He has taken neither a wife nor a son.) meaning, far exalted is He above taking a mate and having children. This means that when the Jinns accepted Islam and believed in the Qur'an they professed Allah's magnificence above having taken a spouse and a child (or a son). Then they said,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى اللَّهِ شَطَطاً\n(And that the foolish among us used to utter against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said,\nسَفِيهُنَا\n(the foolish among us) \"They were referring to Iblis.\"\nشَطَطًا\n(that which was an enormity in falsehood.) As-Suddi reported from Abu Malik that he said, \"This means a transgression.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"A great injustice.\" The foolish (Safih) also carries the meaning of everyone in the category who claims that Allah has a spouse or a son. This is why Allah says here,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا\n(And that the foolish among us used to utter) meaning, before his acceptance of Islam.\nعَلَى اللَّهِ شَطَطاً\n(against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.) meaning, falsehood and a lie. Thus, Allah says,\nوَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن تَقُولَ الإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً\n(And verily, we thought that men and Jinn would not utter a lie against Allah.) meaning, `we did not think that humans and Jinns would join each other in lying about Allah by attributing a spouse and a son to Him. So when we heard this Qur'an we believed in it and we knew that they (Jinns and men) had been lying about Allah in this matter.'\nAmong the Causes of the Transgression of the Jinns were that Humans sought Refuge with Them\nAllah says,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً\n(And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.) meaning, `we used to think that we had some virtuous status over mankind because they used to seek refuge with us whenever they (men) would settle in a valley or any place in the wilderness, the open country steppes and other places.' This was the custom of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They used to seek refuge with the greatest Jinn of a particular place so that no harm or evil would afflict them. Like one would do if he entered into the land of his enemies, in the vicinity of a great and powerful man, he would seek the protection and guardianship of that man. So when the Jinns saw that the humans were seeking refuge with them due to their fear of them, they increased them in Rahaq which means fear, terror and fright. They did this so that the people would be more afraid of them and seek refuge with them even more. As Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,\nفَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً\n(but they increased them in Rahaq.) means, \"the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.\" As-Suddi said, \"A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.\"' Qatadah said, \"When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `Ikrimah that he said, \"The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.' So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.' Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.\" Thus, Allah said,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً\n(And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said,\nرَهَقاً\n(in Rahaq) \"This means in fear.\" Mujahid said, \"The disbelievers would increase in transgression.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّواْ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ أَحَداً\n(And they thought as you thought,) means, \"the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.\" As-Suddi said, \"A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.\"' Qatadah said, \"When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `Ikrimah that he said, \"The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.' So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.' Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.\" Thus, Allah said,\nوَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً\n(And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said,\nرَهَقاً\n(in Rahaq) \"This means in fear.\" Mujahid said, \"The disbelievers would increase in transgression.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّواْ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ أَحَداً\n(And they thought as you thought, that Allah will not send any Messenger.) meaning, Allah would never send a Messenger after this long period of time. This was said by Al-Kalbi and Ibn Jarir."

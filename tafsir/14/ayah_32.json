Certainly, You know what we conceal and what we reveal.) meaning, `You know the intention behind my supplication for the people of this town, seeking Your pleasure in sincerity to You. You know all things, apparent and hidden, and nothing escapes Your knowledge on the earth or in heaven.\"' He next praised and thanked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored for granting him offspring after he became old,\nالْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَسَمِيعُ الدُّعَآءِ\n(All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma'il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac). Verily, my Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.) `He accepts the supplication of those who invoke Him, and has accepted my invocation when I asked Him to grant me offspring. ' Ibrahim said next,\nرَبِّ اجْعَلْنِى مُقِيمَ الصَّلوةِ\n(O my Lord! Make me one who performs Salah,), preserving its obligations and limits,\nوَمِن ذُرِّيَتِى\n(and (also) from my offspring,), make them among those who establish the prayer, as well,\nرَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ\n(our Lord! And accept my invocation.), all of my invocation which I invoked You with herein,\nرَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَالِدَىَّ\n(Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents,) Ibrahim said this before he declared himself innocent from his father, after he became sure that he was an enemy of Allah,\nوَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(and the believers), all of them,\nيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْحِسَابُ\n(on the Day when the reckoning will be established.) on the Day when You will reckon Your servants and recompense or reward them for their deeds - good for good and evil for evil."

    "text": "Allah gives Respite to the Disbelievers and is never unaware of what They do\nAllah says, `O Muhammad, do not think that Allah is unaware of what the unjust disbelievers do. Do not think because Allah gave them respite and delayed their punishment that He is unaware or ignoring punishing them for what they do. Rather, Allah keeps full account of this for them and keeps it on record against them,\nإِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ\n(but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.) from the horror of the Day of Resurrection.' Allah next mentions how they will all be raised up from their graves and hurriedly gathered for the Day of Gathering,\nمُهْطِعِينَ\n(hastening forward), in a hurry. Allah said in other Ayat,\nمُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ\n(Hastening towards the caller.) 54:8\nيَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ الدَّاعِىَ لاَ عِوَجَ لَهُ\n(On that Day mankind will follow strictly Allah's caller, no crookedness will they show him.) 20:108 until,\nوَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ الْقَيُّومِ\n(And (all) faces shall be humbled before the Ever Living, the Sustainer.) 20:111 Allah said: another Ayah,\nيَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ سِرَاعاً\n(The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly.) 70:43 Allah said next,\nمُقْنِعِى رُءُوسِهِمْ\n(with necks outstretched) meaning, raising their heads up, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others. Allah said next,\nلاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ\n(their gaze returning not towards them) meaning, their eyes are staring in confusion, trying not to blink because of the horror and tremendous insights they are experiencing, and fear of what is going to strike them, we seek refuge with Allah from this end. This is why Allah said,\nوَأَفْئِدَتُهُمْ هَوَآءٌ\n(and their hearts empty.) meaning, their hearts are empty due to extreme fear and fright. Qatadah and several others said that the places of their hearts are empty then, because the hearts will ascend to the throats due to extreme fear. Allah said next to His Messenger ,"

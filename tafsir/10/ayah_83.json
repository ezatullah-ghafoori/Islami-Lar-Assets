But they knew that what they were saying was a mere lie. As Allah said:\nوَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً\n(And they belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof. )(27:14) Musa criticized them saying:\nأَتقُولُونَ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَكُمْ أَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُونَقَالُواْ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا\n(\"Say you (this) about the truth when it has come to you Is this magic But the magicians will never be successful.\" They said: \"Have you come to us to turn us away...)\nعَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءابَاءَنَا\n(from that we found our fathers following) their religion.\nوَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا\n(and that you two may have...)\nالْكِبْرِيَآءُ\n(greatness) means grandeur and leadership\nفِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(...in the land, We are not going to believe you two!\")"

    "text": "Musa encouraged His People to put Their Trust in Allah\nAllah told us that Musa said to the Children of Israel:\nيقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ ءامَنْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُواْ إِن كُنْتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ\n(O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims.) Allah is sufficient for those who put their trust in Him.\nأَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُ\n(Is not Allah sufficient for His servant)(39:36)\nوَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ\n(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.)(65:3) Allah combines worship and reliance in many places. He said:\nفَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ\n(So worship Him and put your trust in Him.)(11:123)\nقُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا\n(Say: \"He is the Most Gracious (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust..)(67:29) and\nرَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً\n((He alone is) the Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him (alone) as a protector.)(73:9) And Allah commanded the believers to say many times in their Salah:\nإِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ\n(You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).)(1:5) The Children of Israel complied with this command and said:\nعَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers.) This means don't give them victory over us so that they rule us. So they might not think that they have authority over us because they were following the truth and we were falsehood. This might be a deceiving trial for them. This meaning was reported from Abu Mijliz and Abu Ad-Duha, `Abdur-Razzaq, in a narration from Mujahid, said,\nرَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers) meaning, \"Do not give them authority over us so they might make us fall into Fitnah.\" Allah's statement:\nوَنَجِّنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ\n(And save us by Your mercy) means save us through Your mercy and beneficence\nمِنَ الْقَوْمِ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(from the disbelieving folk. ) meaning, from those who denied the truth and covered it. We truly have believed in You and put our trust in You."

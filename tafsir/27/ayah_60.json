This is like the Ayah,\nوَعَلامَـتٍ وَبِالنَّجْمِ هُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ\n(And landmarks and by the stars, they guide themselves.) (16:16)\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ النُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُواْ بِهَا فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ\n(It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea...) (6:97)\nوَمَن يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرًاَ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy) meaning, ahead of the clouds which bring rain, by means of which Allah shows His mercy to His servants who are suffering drought and despair.\nأَءِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى اللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ\n(Is there any god with Allah Exalted be Allah above all that they associate as partners!)"

It is plain and evident.\nهُدًى وَبُشْرَى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(A guide and glad tidings for the believers.) meaning, guidance and good news may be attained from the Qur'an for those who believe in it, follow it and put it into practice. They establish obligatory prayers, pay Zakah and believe with certain faith in the Hereafter, the resurrection after death, reward and punishment for all deeds, good and bad, and Paradise and Hell. This is like the Ayat:\nقُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ\n(Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears...\") (41:44).\nلِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the Ludd (most quarrelsome) people) (19: 97). Allah says here:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ\n(Verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter,) meaning, those who deny it and think that it will never happen,\nزَيَّنَّا لَهُمْ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ فَهُمْ يَعْمَهُونَ\n(We have made their deeds fair seeming to them, so that they wander about blindly.) means, `We have made what they are doing seem good to them, and We have left them to continue in their misguidance, so they are lost and confused.' This is their recompense for their disbelief in the Hereafter, as Allah says:\nوَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ\n(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away, as they refused to believe therein for the first time) (6:110).\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ لَهُمْ سُوءُ الْعَذَابِ\n(They are those for whom there will be an evil torment.) in this world and the Hereafter.\nوَهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ هُمُ الاٌّخْسَرُونَ\n(And in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers.) means, no one but they, among all the people who will be gathered, will lose their souls and their wealth.\nوَإِنَّكَ لَتُلَقَّى الْقُرْءَانَ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ عَلِيمٍ\n(And verily, you are being taught the Qur'an from One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.)\nوَأَنَّكَ\n(And verily, you) O Muhammad. Qatadah said:\nلَتُلَقَّى\n(are being taught) \"Are receiving.\"\nالْقُرْءَانَ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ عَلِيمٍ\n(the Qur'an from One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.) from One Who is Wise in His commands and prohibitions, and Who knows all things, major and minor. Whatever He says is absolute Truth, and His rulings are entirely fair and just, as Allah says:\nوَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً\n(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6:115)."

    "text": "Musa, peace be upon him, in Madyan, and how He watered the Flocks of the Two Women\nWhen the man told Musa about how Fir`awn and his chiefs were conspiring against him, he left Egypt on his own. He was not used to being alone, because before that he had been living a life of luxury and ease, in a position of leadership.\nفَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَآئِفاً يَتَرَقَّبُ\n(So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear.) meaning, turning around and watching.\nقَالَ رَبِّ نَجِّنِى مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(My Lord! Save me from the people who are wrongdoers!) means, from Fir`awn and his chiefs. It was mentioned that Allah sent to him an angel riding a horse, who showed him the way. And Allah knows best.\nوَلَمَّا تَوَجَّهَ تِلْقَآءَ مَدْيَنَ\n(And when he went towards (the land of) Madyan,) means, he took a smooth and easy route -- and he rejoiced because of that.\nقَالَ عَسَى رَبِّى أَن يَهْدِيَنِى سَوَآءَ السَّبِيلِ\n(he said: \"It may be that my Lord guides me to the right way.\") meaning, the most straight route. And Allah did indeed do that, for He guided him to the straight path in this world and the Hereafter, and caused him to be guided and to guide others.\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan,) means, when he reached Madyan and went to drink from its water, for it had a well where shepherds used to water their flocks,\nوَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ وَوَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمُ امْرَأَتَينِ تَذُودَانِ\n(he found there a group of men watering, and besides them he found two women who were keeping back.) means, they were stopping their sheep from drinking with the sheep of those shepherds, lest some harm come to them. When Musa, peace be upon him, saw them, he felt sorry for them and took pity on them.\nقَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُمَا\n(He said: \"What is the matter with you\") meaning, `why do you not water your flocks with these people'\nقَالَتَا لاَ نَسْقِى حَتَّى يُصْدِرَ الرِّعَآءُ\n(They said: \"We cannot water until the shepherds take...\") meaning, `we cannot water our flocks until they finish.'\nوَأَبُونَا شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ\n(And our father is a very old man.) means, `this is what has driven us to what you see.'\nفَسَقَى لَهُمَا\n(So he watered (their flocks) for them, )\nثُمَّ تَوَلَّى إِلَى الظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَىَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ\n(then he turned back to shade, and said: \"My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!\")\nإِلَى الظِّلِّ\n(to shade,) Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and As-Suddi said: \"He sat beneath a tree.\" `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said: \"When Musa said:\nرَبِّ إِنِّى لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَىَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ\n(\"My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!\") the women heard him.\""

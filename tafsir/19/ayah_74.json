    "text": "Increasing Guidance of Those Who are guided\nAfter Allah mentions the extended time and respite that is allowed to those who are in misguidance, increasing them in misguidance, He informs of the increase in guidance of those who are rightly guided. Similarly He says,\nوَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً\n(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\") 9:124 And the following Ayah also shows this. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَالْبَـقِيَاتُ الصَّـلِحَاتُ\n(And the righteous good deeds that last) Its explanation has already preceded in Surat Al-Kahf, along with a lengthy discussion concerning it and the related Hadiths.\nخَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا\n((they) are better with your Lord for reward.) meaning the recompense and reward.\nوَخَيْرٌ مَّرَدّاً\n(and better for resort.) meaning in the final outcome, the result for its doer."

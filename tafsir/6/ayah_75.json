    "text": "Allah is the Irresistible, Able to Bring Benefit and Protect from Harm\nAllah states that He Alone brings benefit or harm, and that He does what He wills with His creatures, none can resist His judgment or prevent what He decrees,\nوَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلاَ كَـشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدُيرٌ\n(And if Allah touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is able to do all things.) Similarly, Allah said,\nمَّا يَفْتَحِ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ مِن رَّحْمَةٍ فَلاَ مُمْسِكَ لَهَا وَمَا يُمْسِكْ فَلاَ مُرْسِلَ لَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ\n(Whatever mercy, Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter) 35:2. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to supplicate,\n«اللَّهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَد»\n(O Allah, there is none Who can avert what You grant or give what You deprive, and no fortune ever helps the fortunate against You.) This is why Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ\n(And He is the Irresistible, above His servants,) meaning, to Him the necks are subservient, the tyrants humble before Him and He has complete control over all things. The creatures have all bowed to Allah and are humbled before His grace, honor, pride, greatness, highness and ability over all things. The creatures are insignificant before Him, for they are all under His irresistible decision and power,\nوَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ\n(and He is the All-Wise,) in all His actions,\nالْخَبِيرُ\n(Well-Acquainted with all things.) Who places everything in its rightful place, grants and favors whomever deserves His favor. Allah said next,\nقُلْ أَىُّ شَىْءٍ أَكْبَرُ شَهَـدةً\n(Say: \"What thing is the most great in witness\") or what is the greatest witness,\nقُلِ اللَّهِ شَهِيدٌ بِيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ\n(Say: \"Allah (the Most Great!) is Witness between you and I\") for He knows what I brought you and what you will answer me with,\nوَأُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ\n(this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) Therefore, this Qur'an is a warner for all those who hear of it. In another Ayah, Allah said,\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(But those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) 11:17 Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"Those who follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ought to call to what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called to and warn against what he warned against.\" Allah said next,\nأَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَشْهَدُونَ\n(\"Can you verily bear witness...\") O idolators,\nأَنَّ مَعَ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً أُخْرَى قُل لاَّ أَشْهَدُ\n(\"that besides Allah there are other gods\" Say, \"I bear no (such) witness!\") Similarly, in another Ayah, Allah said;\nفَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَلاَ تَشْهَدْ مَعَهُمْ\n(Then if they testify, testify not you with them.) 6:150 Allah said next,\nقُلْ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ وَإِنَّنِى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ\n(Say: \"Only He is God, alone, and truly I am innocent of what you join in worship with Him.\")\nPeople of the Book Recognize the Prophet Just as They Recognize Their Own Children\nAllah says, the People of the Book know what you brought them, O Muhammad , as they know their own children. This is because they received good news from the previous Messengers and Prophets about the coming of Muhammad ﷺ, his attributes, homeland, his migration, and the description of his Ummah. Allah said next,\nالَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُم\n(Those who have lost (destroyed) themselves) and thus incurred the ultimate loss,\nفَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(will not believe.) in this clear matter. A matter about which the previous Prophets gave good news, and a matter extolled about in ancient and modern times. Allah said next,\nوَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِـَايَـتِهِ\n(And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat) meaning, there is no person more unjust than he who lies about Allah and claims that Allah has sent him, while Allah did not send him. There is no person more unjust than he who denies Allah's proofs, signs and evidences,\nإِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الظَّـلِمُونَ\n(Verily, the wrongdoers shall never be successful.) Surely, both of these people will never acquire success, whoever falsely claims that Allah sent him and whoever refuses Allah's Ayat."

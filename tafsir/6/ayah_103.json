    "text": "The Idolators Call On Allah Alone During Torment and Distress\nAllah states that He does what He wills with His creatures and none can resist His decision or avert what He decrees for them. He is the One Who has no partners, Who accepts the supplication from whomever He wills. Allah said,\nقُلْ أَرَأَيْتُكُم إِنْ أَتَـكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمْ السَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Say: \"Tell me if Allah's torment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon any one other than Allah (Reply) if you are truthful!\") This means, you -- disbelievers -- will not call other than Allah in this case, because you know that none except He is able to remove the affliction. Allah said,\nإِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(if you are truthful) by taking gods besides Him.\nبَلْ إِيَّـهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ\n(Nay! To Him alone you call, and, if He willed, He would remove that (distress) for which you call upon Him, and you forget at that time whatever partners you joined with Him (in worship)!) for in times of necessity, you only call on Allah and forget your idols and false deities. In another Ayah, Allah said;\nوَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ\n(And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah)) 17:67. Allah said;\nوَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلنَآ إِلَى أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَـهُمْ بِالْبَأْسَآءِ\n(Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you. And We seized them with extreme poverty...) That is, loss of wealth and diminished provisions,\nوَالضَّرَّآءِ\n(and loss of health) various illnesses, diseases and pain,\nلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ\n(so that they might believe with humility) and call Allah and supplicate to Him with humbleness and humility. Allah said;\nفَلَوْلا إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُواْ\n(When Our torment reached them, why then did they not believe with humility) Meaning: Why do they not believe and humble themselves before Us when We test them with disaster'\nوَلَـكِن قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ\n(But their hearts became hardened,) for their hearts are not soft or humble,\nوَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مَا كَانُواّ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(and Shaytan made fair-seeming to them that which they used to do. ) That is, Shirk, defiance and rebellion.\nفَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ\n(So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded,) by ignoring and turning away from it,\nفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ\n(We opened to them the gates of everything,) Meaning: `We opened the gates of provisions for them from wherever they wished, so that We deceive them.' We seek refuge with Allah from such an end. This is why Allah said,\nحَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ\nf(until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given,) such as wealth, children and provisions,\nأَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ\n(all of a sudden, We took them to punishment and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) They have no hope for any type of good thing. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Whomever Allah gives provision and he thinks that Allah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.\" He then recited the Ayah,\nفَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ\n(So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) He added, \"By the Lord of the Ka`bah! Allah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement."

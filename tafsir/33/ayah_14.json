    "text": "The Command to follow the Messenger ﷺ\nThis Ayah is an important principle, to follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in all his words, and deeds, etc. Hence Allah commanded the people to take the Prophet as an example on the day of Al-Ahzab, with regard to patience, guarding, striving and waiting for Allah to provide the way out; may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him forever, until the Day of Judgement. Allah says to those who were anxious and impatient and were shaken by feelings of panic on the day of Al-Ahzab:\nلَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ\n(Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example to follow) meaning, `why do you not take him as an example and follow his lead' Allah says:\nلِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الاٌّخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً\n(for him who hopes in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much.)\nThe Attitude of the Believers towards the Confederates\nThen Allah tells us about His believing servants who believed Allah's promise to them and how He will make the consequences good for them in this world and in the Hereafter. He says:\nوَلَمَّا رَأَى الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الاٌّحْزَابَ قَالُواْ هَـذَا مَا وَعَدَنَا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَصَدَقَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ\n(And when the believers saw the Confederates, they said: \"This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us; and Allah and His Messenger had spoken the truth.\") Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said: \"They mean what Allah said in Surat Al-Baqarah:\nأَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُم مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مَّسَّتْهُمُ الْبَأْسَآءُ وَالضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلْزِلُواْ حَتَّى يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ مَتَى نَصْرُ اللَّهِ أَلاَ إِنَّ نَصْرَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ\n(Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said,\"When (will come) the help of Allah\" Yes! Certainly, the help of Allah is near!) (2:214) meaning, `this is the trial and test that Allah and His Messenger promised us would be followed by the help and victory of Allah that is near.' Allah says:\nوَصَدَقَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ\n(and Allah and His Messenger had spoken the truth. )\nوَمَا زَادَهُمْ إِلاَّ إِيمَانًا وَتَسْلِيماً\n(And it only added to their faith and to their submissiveness.) This indicates that faith can increase and strengthen in accordance with people's circumstances, as the majority of scholars stated: faith can increase and decrease. We have stated this at the beginning of our commentary on Al-Bukhari, praise be to Allah.\nوَمَا زَادَهُمْ\n(And it only added) means, at that time of stress and difficulty\nإِلاَّ إِيمَانًا\n(to their faith) in Allah,\nوَتَسْلِيماً\n(and to their submissiveness.) means their submission to His commands and their obedience to His Messenger ."

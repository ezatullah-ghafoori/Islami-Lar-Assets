    "text": "Allah said, if they, the disbelievers among the People of the Book and other disbelievers, believe in all of Allah's Books and Messengers and do not differentiate between any of them,\nفَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ\n(then they are rightly guided) meaning, they would acquire the truth and be directed to it.\nوَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ\n(but if they turn away) from truth to falsehood after proof had been presented to them,\nفَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِى شِقَاقٍ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ اللَّهُ\n(then they are only in opposition. So Allah will suffice you against them) meaning, Allah will aid the believers against them,\nوَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(And He is the Hearer, the Knower). Allah said,\nصِبْغَةَ اللَّهِ\n(The Sibghah of Allah). Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"The religion of Allah.\" This Tafsir was also reported of Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Ibrahim, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Abdullah bin Kathir, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and other scholars. The Ayah,\nفِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ\n(Allah's Fitrah (i.e. Allah's Islamic Monotheism)) (30:30) directs Muslims to, \"Hold to it.\""

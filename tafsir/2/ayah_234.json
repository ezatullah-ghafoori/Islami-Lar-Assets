    "text": "The Children of Israel worshipped the Calf\nAllah then said, \"Remember My favor on you when I forgave you for worshipping the calf.\" This happened after Musa went to the meeting place with his Lord at the end of that period which was forty days. These forty days were mentioned in Surat Al-A`raf, when Allah said,\nوَوَعَدْنَا مُوسَى ثَلَـثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ\n(And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and added (to the period) ten (more)) (7:142).\nIt was said that these days were during the month of Dhul-Qa`dah plus the first ten days in Dhul-Hijjah, after the Children of Israel were delivered from Fir`awn and they safely crossed the sea. Allah's statement,\nوَإِذْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ\n(And (remember) when We gave Musa the Scripture) means, the Tawrah,\nوَالْفُرْقَانِ\n(And the criterion) that is that which differentiates between truth and falsehood, guidance and deviation.\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ\n(So that you may be guided aright), after escaping the sea, as another Ayah in Surat Al-A`raf clearly stated,\nوَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا الْقُرُونَ الاٍّولَى بَصَآئِرَ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ\n(And indeed We gave Musa ـ after We had destroyed the generations of old ـ the Scripture (the Tawrah) as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might remember (or receive admonition)) (28:43)."

    "text": "The terrible End the Disbelievers will meet on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah the Exalted says, `O Muhammad, turn away from these people who, when they witness a miracle, they deny it and say that this is continuous magic.' Turn away from them and wait until,\nيَوْمَ يَدْعُو الدَّاعِ إِلَى شَىْءٍ نُّكُرٍ\n(The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing.) to the Recompense and the afflictions, horrors and tremendous hardships that it brings forth,\nخُشَّعاً أَبْصَـرُهُمْ\n(with humbled eyes), their eyes will be covered with disgrace,\nيَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ\n(they will come forth from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread abroad.) They will gather towards the area of Reckoning in such haste and crowds, in response to the caller, as if they were crowds of locusts spreading all about. Allah said,\nمُهْطِعِينَ\n(Hastening) meaing hurriedly,\nإِلَى الدَّاعِ\n(towards the caller.) without being able to hesitate or slow down,\nيَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ\n(The disbelievers will say: \"This is a hard Day.\"), meaing, `this is a hard, terrible, horrifying and distressful Day,'\nفَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ\n(Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the dis- believers.) (74:9-10)"

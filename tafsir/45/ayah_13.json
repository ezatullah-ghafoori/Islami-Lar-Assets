    "text": "Preference of Allah to the Children of Israel and their dispute thereafter\nAllah the Exalted mentions the favors He granted the Children of Israel, such as revealing the Divine Books to them, sending the Messengers to them and granting them kingship. Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ\n(And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things,) such as foods and drinks,\nوَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ\n(and preferred them above the nations.) of their time,\nوَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ\n(And gave them clear proofs in matters.) `We gave them evidences, proofs and unequivocal signs.' Therefore, the proof has been established against them, yet they differed among themselves after the proof came to them, out of transgression against each other,\nإِنَّ رَبَّكَ\n(Verily, your Lord) `O Muhammad',\nيَقْضِى بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ\n(will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ. ) He will judge between them by His just judgement.\nWarning to this Ummah against following the Ways of the Children of Israel\nThis Ayah contains a warning to the Muslim Ummah as well. It warns them not to take the path the Jews took nor adopt their ways. This is why Allah said,\nثُمَّ جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَى شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا\n(Then We have put you on a (legal) way of commandment. So follow you that.) `follow what was revealed to you from your Lord, O Muhammad, there is no true deity except Him, and turn away from the idolators.' Allah said,\nوَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَإِنَّهُمْ لَن يُغْنُواْ عَنكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ\n(and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah. Verily, the wrongdoers are protecting friends of one another,) Allah says, `what will the loyalty that the idolators give each other avail them' Indeed, all they will earn from their protecting friends is more loss, destruction and demise,\nوَاللَّهُ وَلِىُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ\n(but Allah is the Protector of those who have Taqwa.) and He will deliver them from the darkness to the light. In contrast, all the false deities are the protecting friends of those who disbelieve, taking them out of the light to the darkness. Allah said,\nهَـذَا بَصَـئِرُ لِلنَّاسِ\n(This is a clear insight and evidence for man- kind,) in reference to the Qur'an,\nوَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ\n(and a guidance and a mercy for people who have faith with certainty.)"
